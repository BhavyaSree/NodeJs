## Security Best Practices and suggestions

### Compromised Database

- Strongly encrypt passwords with salt and hash (bcrypt)
- Strongly encrypt password reset token (sha256)

### Brute Force Attacks

Attacker tries to guess the password, by trying millions of passwords.

- Use bcrypt (to make login requests slow)
- Implement rate limiting (express-rate-limit) -- limit the number of attempts to login from a single IP address
- Implement maximum login attempts

### Cross-site scripting (XSS) Attacks

Attacker tries to inject the script into page to run his malicious code.

- Store JWT n HTTPonly cookies
- Sanitize user input data
- Set special HTTP headers (helmet package)

### Denial-of-service (DOS) Attack

Attacker sends so many requests to the server that it breaks down and the application will go unavailable

- Implement rate limiting (express-rate-limit)
- Limit body payload(in body-parser)
- Avoid evil regular expressions in the code

## NOSQL Query Injection

Instead of inputing valid data, attacker inputs the query, inorder to create query expressions which we used in code.

- Use mongoose for MongoDB (because of schema types)
- Sanitize user input data

### Other best practices and suggestions

- Always use HTTPS
- Create random password tokens with expiry dates
- Deny access to JWT after password change
- Don't commit sensitive config data to Git
- Don't send error details to clients
- Prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (csurf package)
- Require re-authentication before a high-value action.
- Implement a blacklist of untrusted JWT
- Confirm user email address after first creating account.
- Keep user logged in with refresh tokens
- Implement two-factor authentication.
- Prevent parameter pollution causing uncaught exceptions.
