## What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a NoSQL database.

In Mongo,

- each database contains one or more collections (Tables).
- Each collection contains one or more data structures called document (Rows)
- Each document contains a data about a single entity.  
  For example like one blogPost, one user, one review.
- Document will have a data format like JSON.

MongoDB is a document database with scalability and flexibility that you want and with the querying and indexing that you need.

Key Features of MongoDB

- **Document based** - MongoDB stores data in documents (field value pair data structures like JSON, NoSQL)
- **Scalable** - Very easy to distribute data across multiple machines as your users and amount of data grows.
- **Flexible** - No document data schema required, so each document can have different number and type of fields.
- **Performant** - Embedded data models,indexing, sharding, flexible documents, native duplication, etc
- Free and open source, published under the SSPL License.

### BSON

- MongoDB uses a data format called BSON for data storage.
- BSON is like JSON but typed(means all values will have data type such as string, boolean, double etc,.). So MongoDB documents are typed.  
  Like JSON, BSON documents will also have fields and data stored in key-value pairs.
- **Embedding/Denormalizing** - Including related data into a single document. This allows for quicker access and easier data models.
- Maximum size of BSON document is 16MB.
- Each document contains unique Id, which acts as a primary key of the document. This is automatically generated with ObjectId datatype each time there is a new document.
