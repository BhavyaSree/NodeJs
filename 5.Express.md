## Express

* Express is minimal node.js framework (that means express is built on top of node.js), a higher level of abstraction.
* Express contains a very robust set of features: complex routing, easier handling of requests and responses, middleware, server-side rendering etc,.
* Express allows for rapid development of node.js applications. (like routing and templating systems are already included in express and ready to use).
* Express makes it easier to organize our application into MVC architecture.  

*Postman simplifies API development*  
Postman is a tool, that allows us to perform API testing.
